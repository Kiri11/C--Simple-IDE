This project consist of:

1. Executable file "C-- Simple IDE.exe". The program provides interface for compiling C-- code into assembler code. ASM code is saved in file "asmCode.asm". 
It is possible to compile the MASM code further into binary code and run the program. Batch files and Irvine library are used for this (folder "Lib"). 
To properly run binary code MS Visual Studio must be installed.

2. Several tests I used in the "Tests" folder.
